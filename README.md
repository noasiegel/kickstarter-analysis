-Based on the graph above, Louise already is in a good place knowing she wants to crowdfund a play. From 2009-2017, in the US, Plays have been the most successful in receiving the amount of funding necessary.
![US Goal + Pledged (Musicals)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110838228/185807338-cceb2072-5d16-4179-acd9-1d4b97a842d6.png)
-Based on the boxplot above, Louise might want to reevaluate her budget. The mean pledging amount for Musicals is around $3,000. While there are a few outliers that indicate it is possible to get larger donations, the data shows that even on the high end of amount pledged will fall under the median goal.
-My recommendation would be for Louise to reduce her goal budget to $5,000.
-As we can see in the data chart below, the median funding goal of successful Plays is $5,049 and mean pledged of successful plays is $5,602. We can see from this chart that the higher the pledge goal is, the more likely it is that a funding goal is not reached. While a pledg goal of $5,000 is only half of what Louise needs, it is better to have a show funded with less money than no show at all!

-Even though Louise might need to cut her budget/pledging ask in half, based on the line graph above, the Theater category has had the most success from 2013-2017 in recieving the funding necessary to get the show on stage. This indicates a trend that this category, regardless of asking budget, is more likely to be successful, which is great news for Louise!
